## Introduction

On Olympus, the options window has been remade into a custom version. It is much more convenient than the original, and enables adding more options than the original window could support.

### How do I open the options window?

You can open the options window by clicking on the gear icon at the bottom right of the screen :

### How does the options window work?

On the left there is a list of tabs, corresponding to the category of options. By default All is selected, which lists every option on the right side of the window. By clicking on a tab only the options in that category will be shown. In the top left there is a search bar, which you can use to search for a specific option. Clicking on the small square box next to an option's name toggles it on or off. You can scroll up and down the list of options with your mouse wheel.
