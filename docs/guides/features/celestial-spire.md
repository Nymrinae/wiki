# What is The Infinite Celestial Tower?

The Infinite Celestial Spire is a challenge in which the best PvE players will demonstrate the potential of their characters, it is a game mode in which you will have to protect the Totem of hordes of mobs that will increase their difficulty progressively with each floor.
Any type of healing (titles or potions) will be forbidden inside the tower increasing even more the difficulty of this one.
To help us stop the hordes we have the help of Teams, which be made up of Pets and Partners that are under our acquisition.

# How to access The Celestial Tower?

To access the Celestial Infinite Tower you need to have finished all the QuestLine of act 7.2, once you have finished you have to talk to **Celestial Tower Guard**, he give you access to the tower.

To enter any floor you need a <img src="https://cdn.olympusgg.com/images/4301.png" width="25"/> Celestial Spire Key, you can get them by exchanging Infinity Coins in the Celestial Spire Shop or as a reward when you finish a floor of the tower.

# Ranking and Rewards 

As with RBB, the celestial tower has a rank window where the strongest players within it will be shown. Ranking will be based on the highest floor each player reaches, followed by the best time to complete each floor.

Once we reach the 50th floor we will get a <img src="https://cdn.olympusgg.com/images/4302.png" width="25"/>Celestial Spire Reset Ticket, which will allow us to reset our progress in the tower, sending us straight back to floor 1 again. You must be careful! This ticket will delete your current record once you use it.
On the first day of each month, monthly rewards will be given to players who have actively participated in the tower. The very best of each class will get "Hero of the Celestial Tower" title, but all top 30 will get a special Spire Chest and some random boxes too. Spire Chests contain different amounts of Corrupted Fragments, Legendary Medal of Honour, and Infinity Coins.
