## How can I get the seals?

We have two options for obtaining the Paimon raid seals:

- Celestial Spire Shop: We will be able to craft the seals in the celestial spire shop for the modest price of 1 Infinity Coin.

- Farming: As with the Belial seals, we can obtain Paimon's seals by farming within the Celestial Spire Maps.

## Raid Mechanics
With the arrival of Act 7.2 we can officially welcome Evil Overlord Paimon, unlike the original raid the mechanics of this raid have been modified in Olympus to give it more versatility and room for other specialists. Like the previous 3 raids we find a pre-room in which we find a lever ![](https://imageshack.com/i/poeMcLMPp) which have to operate. In the next room we find the main boss, Evil Overlord Paimon, accompanied this time by the 3 shadows of the bosses of the raids predecessors to this one, this time the element of the main boss has been changed to water element, giving way to new team compositions.
We can see that Paimon will be at the top of the map without moving, this is because he has a buff that block practically all the damage he receives.

In order to remove this buff we will have to defeat the mini-bosses that will be waiting in the middle of the map. In addition to these mini-bosses we will be able to notice that every certain amount of time a horde of mobs will appear, to be able to stop the respawn of these mobs we have to use the totem that is in the middle of the map.
Once the three mini-bosses have been eliminated we can start beating Paimon.

## Recommendations for the Raid
- It is recommended to go with equipment of hero level c60 r7-r8+8+9+10.
- Options of shells like: 
	- <font color="#ccff99">S- Increased Damage to High-Level Races: x%</font>
	- <font color="#ccff99">S- Increased Overall Attack: x%</font>
	- <font color="#ffff00">B- Increased Damage to Monster Races: x%</font>
- Use the Twilight Gem III Trophy ![](https://imageshack.com/i/pnGxom6Kp) , as resistances reduction is one of the best stats for raiding/PvE (all other major Trophies of each class in tier III are viable for this raid as well).

## Ideal Raid Group

Since the Belial is water element, almost any SP that is of the element of fire will work in this raid, the most recommended ones are the following:

- ![](https://cdn.olympusgg.com/images/901.png) **Warrior Specialist Card** . It will help us to draws mini-bosses in the middle of the map.
- ![](https://cdn.olympusgg.com/images/2544.png) **Gladiator Specialist Card** . It has a very high attack speed combined with a lot of damage and can also cause "Shaky Status" to Paimon.

- ![](https://cdn.olympusgg.com/images/905.png) **Red Magician Specialist Card** . Great elemental power as well as a basic with great power, speed and area, helping us with clearing mini-bosses.

- ![](https://cdn.olympusgg.com/images/909.png) **Crusader Specialist Card** . Thanks to his holy breath can help us to reduce 10 extra resistances to Paimon.
- ![](https://cdn.olympusgg.com/images/911.png) **Destroyer Specialist Card** . Almost necessary in every raid in the game thanks to the gas, as well as providing good damage in the raid.
- ![](https://cdn.olympusgg.com/images/2545.png) **Fire Cannoneer Specialist Card** . Another alternative to the destroyer with good sustainable damage.
- ![](https://cdn.olympusgg.com/images/912.png)  **Wild Keeper Specialist Card** : Like the destroyer, the WK is a necessary sp in almost any raid due to its Elemental Leech.
- ![](https://cdn.olympusgg.com/images/914.png)  **Dark Gunner Specialist Card** : Good critical damage as well as an extra 10 resistance drain.
