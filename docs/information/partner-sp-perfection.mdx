# **Partner Specialist Perfectioning**

## **What is Partner Specialist Perfectioning?**
PSP Perfectioning is a new way of enhancing your partners to be more formidable companions.
All PSPs can be perfected with the same stone, Emerald of Perfection <img src="https://cdn.olympusgg.com/images/25115.png" height="20"/>, which is exclusively available in Celestial Spire Random Box <img src="https://cdn.olympusgg.com/images/4303.png" height="20"/>.

## **How to Use?**

Once you have emeralds, head to a SP perfectioner, like Malcolm Mix, and simpy insert in the PSP you want to perfect.

You can see that once a PSP is inserted, "Element" icon becomes replaced with "Crit Damage Reduction" icon. This is the only difference between perfecting an SP and a PSP.

## **Details**

Upon a succesful upgrade, PSP will get a certain amount of points on one of the eight possible stats:
- +20 Attack
- +10 Defense
- 1% Critical Damage Reduction
- +300 HP/MP
- +1 Fire Resistance
- +1 Water Resistance
- +1 Light Resistance
- +1 Shadow Resistance

Perfection progress of the PSP can be viewed with right click:

| Range | Stones Needed | Gold Needed | Points Given
|----------|----------|----------|--------|
| +1 to +10 | 1 <img src="https://cdn.olympusgg.com/images/25115.png" height="10"/> | 50k <img src="https://cdn.olympusgg.com/images/1046.png" height="10"/> | 1
| +11 to +20 | 1 <img src="https://cdn.olympusgg.com/images/25115.png" height="10"/> | 100k <img src="https://cdn.olympusgg.com/images/1046.png" height="10"/> | 2
| +21 to +40 | 2 <img src="https://cdn.olympusgg.com/images/25115.png" height="10"/> | 200k <img src="https://cdn.olympusgg.com/images/1046.png" height="10"/> | 3

| +61 to +80 | 4 <img src="https://cdn.olympusgg.com/images/25115.png" height="10"/> | 400k <img src="https://cdn.olympusgg.com/images/1046.png" height="10"/> | 5
| +81 to +100 | 5 <img src="https://cdn.olympusgg.com/images/25115.png" height="10"/> | 500k <img src="https://cdn.olympusgg.com/images/1046.png" height="10"/> | 6

## **Tips**
- It is possible to maximize three stats on a single +100 PSP. You can easily aim for maximum HP/MP and attack.
- Perfecting a PSP to +100 costs about 1000 Emeralds and 50kk Gold. 
- Unlike SP perfectioning, there isn't much difference between an average roll and a good roll, unless you're too unlucky, you can just perfect it once and use it forever without any need to reroll.
